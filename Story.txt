A long long time ago, in a galaxy far away, there was a middle aged, heavy set man named Norm who spent most of his days in a ratskeller drinking cheap mead.
Norm was a quiet man who made a small fortune traveling the world in Lederhose to compete in Bratwurst eating contests. 
Norm had a schnapsidee to call Schneewittchen and ask her out to watch a rammstein if she makes him brot.
She refused to make the brot and angrily retreated to his luftschoss where he enjoyed his own stash of brot.
while speeding down the Hauptstrasse in his BMW he decided to stop in Berlin for more mead. 
He stopped at the Biergarten for only a small amount of mead, but then things escalated.
18 hours later, Norm was found sleeping in an alley in Berlin wearing only a Dirndel, it was at this point he started to question his life choices. 
After much self reflection, Norm took the next flughafen back to Schneewittchen to win her back. 
Schneewittchen is a strong indpendent woman and refused to take Norm back. she then lived happily ever after with her laptop, 5 dogs and 2 baby goats.
Norm while sitting in his BMW with the Klimaanlage at full blast, decided it was time to make a change and so he drove down the Hauptstrasse looking to better himself and seek a new life.
