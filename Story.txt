A long long time ago, in a galaxy far away, there was a middle aged, heavy set man named Norm who spent most of his days in a ratskeller drinking cheap mead.
Norm was a quiet man who made a small fortune traveling the world in Lederhose to compete in Bratwurst eating contests. 
Norm had a schnapsidee to call Schneewittchen and ask her out to watch a rammstein and listen to musik. She agreed but only if he makes her his famous brot.
She refused to make the brot, so Norm angrily retreated to his luftschoss where he had his own stash of brot.
