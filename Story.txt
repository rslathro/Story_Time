A long long time ago, in a galaxy far away, there was a middle aged, heavy set man named Norm who spent most of his days in a ratskeller drinking cheap mead.
Norm was a quiet man who made a small fortune traveling the world in Lederhose to compete in Bratwurst eating contests. 
Norm had a schnapsidee to call Schneewittchen and ask her out to watch a rammstein if she makes him brot.
He refused to make the brot and angrily retreated to his luftschoss where he enjoyed his own stash of brot.
while speeding down the Hauptstrasse in his BMW he decided to stop in Berlin for more mead. 
He stopped at the Biergarten for only a small amount of mead, but then things escalated.
